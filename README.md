# Frameless
A mod for Minecraft that allows for item frames to be made invisible by hitting them with a glass pane.

This mod can be loaded server-side-only (i.e it supports vanilla clients in a dedicated server environment).
The glass pane is not consumed for creative players, following standard item consumption logic, and will be
dropped when the item frame is broken.
